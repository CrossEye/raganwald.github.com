### ayoayo

Ayoayo is played on the most common layout, a board with two rows of six pits. Many boards also provide with a pit on each side of the board for "captured" seeds, but this is optional when playing Ayoayo.

The players face each other with the board between them, such that each player has a row of six pits in front of them. These pits "belong" to that player. If extra pits are provided for captured seeds, each player takes one for themselves, but the extra pits are not in play. (In some other games in the same family, pits for captured seeds are used in play.)

We've mentioned capturing seeds several times, and for good reason: The game play consists of capturing seeds, and when the game is completed, the player who has captured the most seeds, wins.

The rules are simple:

*The game begins with four seeds in each of the twelve pits. Thus, the game requires 48 seeds. Pebbles, marbles, or even lego pieces can be used to represent the seeds. A wooden board is nice, but pits can be scooped out of earth or sand to make a board. This extreme simplicity is part of the game's charm, much as tic-tac-toe's popularity stems in part from the fact that you can play a game with little more than a stick and a piece of flat earth.*

*The players alternate turns, as in may games.*

*On a player's turn, they select one of their pits to "sow." There are some exceptions listed below, but in general if the player has more than one pit with seeds, they may select which one to sow. There are many variations on rules for how to sow the seeds amongst the Mancala family of games, but in Ayoayo, sowing works like this:*

- The player scoops all of the seeds from the starting pit into their hand.
- Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed into each pit.
- On their row, they move from left to right.
- If they reach the end of their row, they move from right to left on their opponent's row (thus "counter-clockwise").
- They always skip the starting pit on their row.
- The sowing pauses when they have sowed the last seed in their hand.

*If the last seed lands in a pit on either side of the board that contains one or more seeds, they scoop the seeds up (including that last seed), and continue sowing. They continue to skip their original starting pit only, but can sow into any pits that get scooped up in this manner. This is called **relay sowing**.*

*If the last seed lands in an empty pit **on that player's own side**, the player "captures" any seeds that are in the pit on the opponent's side of the board from their last pit.*

*If a player has no move on their turn, the game ends, and their opponent captures any remaining seeds (which will--of course--be on their side)*.

*If a player is able to make a move that leaves their opponent with one or more moves to make, they must make a move that leaves their opponent with one or more moves to make. If a player has several such moves (as is usually the case), the player may choose which move to make.*

If we were going to make an Ayoayo program, where would we start?

### the first attempt at ayoayo

Let's start with a simple idea: We'll have to represent the state of the game. We could use an array for the twelve pits of the game, with an integer representing the number of seeds in that put. We'll initialize it with four seeds in each pit:

```javascript
const pits = Array(12).fill(4);
```

We'll associate the elements of the array with the pits belonging to the players like this:

[![Associating array elements with pits](/assets/images/ayoayo/3.png)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/narasclicks/4654106883/)

There are lots of places to go from here, but for the sake of argument, let's begin with a function that scoops any pit and sows the seeds counter-clockwise. In Ayoayo, a full turn involves relay sowing as described above:

> When relay sowing, if the last seed during sowing lands in an occupied hole, all the contents of that hole, including the last sown seed, are immediately re-sown from the hole.

The other kind of sowing, as used in other games from the same family, is just called _sowing_. The sowing stops when the last seed is sown, regardless of whether the last seed lands in an occupied or unoccupied pit. It's fairly obvious that if we make a function for sowing, we can use that to make a function for relay sowing, so let's start with a sowing function:

```javascript
function sow(fromPit, skipPit = fromPit) {
  // empty the pit into the hand
  let seedsInHand = pits[fromPit];
  pits[fromPit] = 0;

  // an unexpected condition
  if (seedsInHand === 0) return;

  // let's go!
  let pitToSow = fromPit;

  while (seedsInHand > 0) {
    pitToSow = ++pitToSow % pits.length;
    if (pitToSow === skipPit) continue;

    ++pits[pitToSow];
    --seedsInHand;
  }

  return pitToSow;
}

sow(0)
  //=> 4
pits
  //=> [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

We can test it by hand. We start with the board looking like this:

![initial position](/assets/images/ayoayo/4.jpg)

And after sowing once, it looks like this:

![position after sowing from position zero](/assets/images/ayoayo/5.jpg)

Now, there were five seeds in the last pit (pit `4`). If there are two or more seeds in the last pit, it wasn't empty before we sowed the last seed into it. So when relay sowing, we'd sow again, only this time we'll tell our function to keep ignoring pit `0`, like this:

```javascript
sow(4, 0)
  //=> 9
```

Five seeds in the last pit (`9`), Let's do it again:

```javascript
sow(9, 0)
  //=> 3
```

Six seeds in pit `3`! Again:

```javascript
sow(3, 0)
  //=> 9

pits
  //=> [0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 5, 5]
```

Aha, just one seed in pit `9`, we're done. Let's try it by hand, remembering to skip pit `0`, and compare:

![position after relay sowing from position zero](/assets/images/ayoayo/6.jpg)


We're off to a reasonable start.

### a most practical consideration

Let's look at our calls to `sow` again:

```javascript
sow(0)
sow(4, 0)
sow(9, 0)
sow(3, 0)
 ```

Shall we try it again?

```javascript
sow(0)
  //=> undefined
```

D'oh! We forgot to reset the board. Our `sow` function relies upon a mutable value from outside of its body--`pits`--and indeed it mutates that value by changing the contents of the array. Thus, when you invoke `sow`, you don't know what you're going to get unless you already know the state of `pits`.

We say that `sow` is *coupled* to `pits`. In order to test `sow`, we have to first carefully set up `pits` to align with our expectations. We see this kind of thing when writing production code for large systems: Many tests do more work setting up and tearing down all of the required initial conditions than they do actually testing functions and methods.

So coupling a function to a mutable value requires us to keep track of that value in order to understand what `sow` will or won't do. That adds some complexity to understanding our system. And this coupling is *transitive*: Not only is `sow` coupled to `pits`, any other function we write that is coupled to `pits`, becomes coupled to `sow`. Running `sow` changes the behaviour of any  function coupled to `pits` because `sow` mutates `pits`.

In fact, `sow` is coupled to itself! Even if we remember to correctly initialize `pits` before running `sow`, the order in which we invoke `sow` affects the results.

Having a single variable, `pits` describing the state of the game in progress does feel intuitively sound. There is only one board in the game, and when we sow seeds, we change it. So why shouldn't we "model the real world accurately?"

That question is easy to answer: I used to own a typewriter. It had no "undo." It had no "copy" or "paste," those functions were accomplished by making copies of pages and laboriously cutting sections of text out with an x-acto blade and gluing them onto other pieces of paper. The text editor I am using now is superior to my typewriter precisely because it does not insist on modelling the real world accurately.

Modelling the real world is a tool for exploring ideas in software and for helping others read our software: What is familiar, subjectively feels "intuitive."[^raskin] But when the modelling interferes with our ability to understand our software's behaviour, we should relax our desire to make everything about modelling. What we seek is maximum understandability and maximum flexibility, not maximum fidelity.

So how can we "decouple" or code from itself and each other?

### decoupling code from shared state

The easiest thing is the obvious thing: If a function shares state with another function (or itself!), and we wish to remove the coupling caused by changes to the shared state, we rewrite the functions to get rid of the shared state. This is an easy refactoring:

- We take all of the references to shared state that the function must read, and replace them with parameters.
- We take all of the references to shared state that the function must write, and replace them with creating a *copy* of the shared state. We then return that copy along with any other return values the function already has.

So our `sow` function becomes:

```javascript
function sow(initialState, fromPit, skipPit = fromPit) {
  const pits = initialState.slice(0);

  // empty the pit into the hand
  let seedsInHand = pits[fromPit];
  pits[fromPit] = 0;

  // an unexpected condition
  if (seedsInHand === 0) return;

  // let's go!
  let pitToSow = fromPit;

  while (seedsInHand > 0) {
    pitToSow = ++pitToSow % pits.length;
    if (pitToSow === skipPit) continue;

    ++pits[pitToSow];
    --seedsInHand;
  }

  return [pits, pitToSow];
}
```

And we use it like this:

```javascript
let gamePits = Array(12).fill(4);

sow(gamePits, 0)
  //=> [
         [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
         4
       ]
```

If we want to update the game state, we can choose to do that:

```javascript
let gamePits = Array(12).fill(4);
let lastPit

[gamePits, lastPit] = sow(gamePits, 0);

gamePits
  //=> [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

Well. At first sight, there seem to be more moving parts with this approach. But in truth, they were always there, it's just that we "lifted" them into the interface of the `sow` function where we can see them. And now, we can test any arbitrary invocation without having to remember to set things up in advance.

For example, here's the second call we made:

```javascript
sow([0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], 4, 0)
  //=> [
         [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4],
         9
       ]
```

Checks out, and so do the third and fourth calls we made:

```javascript
sow([0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4], 9, 0)
  //=> [
         [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
         3
       ]

sow([0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], 3, 0)
  //=> [
         [0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 5, 5],
         9
       ]
```

We get to the same place, but we can run our "tests" in any order and don't have to do any set up in advance.

The lesson learned is that decoupling functions from mutable state makes them easier to understand and test. And if we want to model the "real world" by having a value representing the current game state, we can still do that:

```javascript
let gamePits = Array(12).fill(4);

let initialChoice = 0;
let lastPit = initialChoice;

[gamePits, lastPit] = sow(gamePits, lastPit, initialChoice);
[gamePits, lastPit] = sow(gamePits, lastPit, initialChoice);
[gamePits, lastPit] = sow(gamePits, lastPit, initialChoice);
[gamePits, lastPit] = sow(gamePits, lastPit, initialChoice);

gamePits[lastPit]
  //=> 1

gamePits
  //=> [0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 5, 5]
```

Now let's automate the "relay sowing."

### relay sowing

We have implemented "relay sowing" by hand above. It's time to write a `relaySow` function. We could modify `sow`, but accreting new functionality on top of old is a recipe for bloat.

How do we start `relaySow`? Well, with `sow`:

```javascript
function relaySow(before, fromPit, skipPit = fromPit) {
  let [after, lastPit] = sow(before, fromPit, skipPit);

  // what happens next?
}
```

Well, what **does** happen next? I think we know the answer: We need to check and see whether the number of seeds in the last pit is one or not:

```javascript
function relaySow(before, fromPit, skipPit = fromPit) {
  let [after, lastPit] = sow(before, fromPit, skipPit);

  if (after[lastPit] === 1) {
    return [after, lastPit];
  } else {
    // now what?
  }
}
```

"Now what," indeed. Now what? We can't just call `sow` again and return the result, that won't work if we end up needing to sow a third time. We'd need all sorts of nested `if` statements. Yecch.

We *could* rewrite `relaySow` to have a loop of so kind, maybe `do { ... } while (...)`. But hang on!

`relaySow` returns the state of the board after relay sowing, right? And if we end up with more than one seed in the final pit, what do we have? A state, and a desire to do more relay sowing. With this insight, the code writes itself:

```javascript
function relaySow(before, fromPit, skipPit = fromPit) {
  let [after, lastPit] = sow(before, fromPit, skipPit);

  if (after[lastPit] === 1) {
    return [after, lastPit];
  } else {
    return relaySow(after, lastPit, skipPit);
  }
}

let gamePits = Array(12).fill(4);
let lastPit;

[gamePits, lastPit] = relaySow(gamePits, 0);

lastPit
  //=> 9

gamePits
  //=> [0, 6, 6, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 5, 5]
```

Well how about that. The recursive solution is actually the most straightforward to explain and to implement.

*To be continued...*
